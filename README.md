# in this project I have developed one responsive web application  based on Angular 7, Bootstrap 4 and integrated with Google map using Angular google map package.  To access this application user has to register using Sign up window . After succesful sign up . user  has to perform login action. After successful login, user has access of Dashboard where he/she can trace out nearset location and there. I have shown multiple different color markes with info window with it. Info window shows us importanat monuments of that particular location and name of the location.

# npm scripts
These are the most useful commands defined in package.json: npm start - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode". npm run build - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once. npm run build:watch - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into dist/. npm run lint - runs tslint on the project files. npm run serve - runs lite-server. Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
